      <p><strong>Roles:</strong> Game design, narrative design, programming, room level design, puzzle design, room UI/UX, sound design.<br> My most ambitious project yet. Created over the course of three months by a team of four, this game blends <strong>narrative storytelling with horror platforming</strong>. You play as Aislinn, a young woman from Nova Scotia who is trapped in a recurring nightmare. <strong>Will she ever break free from the curse?</strong> </p>

      <p><strong>Role:</strong> Level Designer.<br> This project began as a school assignment developed by a team of two. Together, we came up with the idea of a laser that players must direct to unlock levels. I was primarily responsible for <strong>designing the levels</strong>, while my teammate handled the programming.</p>

      <p><strong>Roles:</strong> Everything!<br> My very first game, made in just one month!
I did <strong>everything myself</strong> — programming, level design, sound design — you name it.
The only thing I didn’t create were the visuals, which come from the amazing asset packs by <strong>Ansimuz</strong>.
I’m sharing this project because it marks my very <strong>first encounter with the art of game design</strong>, and it shows how quickly I picked up the foundations of the craft.
