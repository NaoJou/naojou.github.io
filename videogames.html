      <p><strong>Roles:</strong> Game design, level design, UI/UX design, sound design.<br> Created in 48h for the <strong>Kenney Game Jam 2025</strong> (theme: Power). What happens when you give <strong>tortured lab rats</strong> the ability to absorb electricity, multiply, and fry their captors alive? In this <strong>puzzle-platformer</strong> gone rogue, you control a swarm of vengeful rats <strong>on a mission to escape</strong> a brutal research facility. The catch? Every trap kills. Every rat counts. And the only way to grow your army is to steal power from the humans who abused you.
 Is it dark? Yes. Is it absurd? Absolutely. Will you regret playing it? Only if you hate freedom. üêÄ <strong>Lead the revolt. Chew through the wires. Unleash your inner swarm.</strong> </p>

      <p><strong>Role:</strong> Level Designer.<br> This project began as a school assignment developed by a team of two. Together, we came up with the idea of a laser that players must direct to unlock levels. I was primarily responsible for <strong>designing the levels</strong>, while my teammate handled the programming.</p>

      <p><strong>Roles:</strong> Everything!<br> My very first game, made in just one month!
I did <strong>everything myself</strong> ‚Äî programming, level design, sound design ‚Äî you name it.
The only thing I didn‚Äôt create were the visuals, which come from the amazing asset packs by <strong>Ansimuz</strong>.
I‚Äôm sharing this project because it marks my very <strong>first encounter with the art of game design</strong>, and it shows how quickly I picked up the foundations of the craft.
